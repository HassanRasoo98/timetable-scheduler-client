# timetable-scheduler-client
This repository contains the backend code for the client side of the timetable viewer app -- version 2.0.
Use the app on this link: https://isb-fastnuces-timetable-scheduler.streamlit.app/

# Note
This application is no longer being maintained because I have passed out from FAST. I am looking for volunteers who want to continue this project.
